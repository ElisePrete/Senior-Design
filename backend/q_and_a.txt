q: Social Security Disability Benefits for Gulf War Syndrome link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/disability/veterans-disability/social-security-disability ans:If you have been awarded VA disability benefits, this doesn't mean you will necessarily be approved for SSDI or SSI. It's also true that being denied VA benefits doesn't preclude you from getting benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). This is because the VA and the Social Security Administration (SSA) have different qualification requirements and application processes.
q: Getting Social Security Disability Benefits as a Wounded Warrior link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability/getting-social-security-disabi ans:When you first apply for disability, you must let the SSA know that your medical condition began while you were on active duty. You must also tell the SSA the location where your military records are kept. Although the Department of Defense routinely sends reports the names of ill or injured service members to the SSA, these reports can be incomplete. Therefore, when you file for disability with the SSA, you must make sure that you provide the SSA with proof that you are, or were, a service member.

q: Getting Both Social Security and VA Veterans Disability Benefits link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/disability/disability-social-security/overview-social-security-va-veterans-disability ans:One major difference between Social Security disability and veterans disability is that you don't need to be totally disabled in order to be eligible for VA compensation. In fact, most veterans who receive VA compensation do not receive a total disability rating. Veterans can receive a compensable rating as low as 10%, and can even have a rating as low as 0%. (In many cases, it's beneficial to get a 0% rating even though its not compensable, because the veteran will at least have proven a service-connected disability. If it deteriorates into a more serious problem, it can turn into a compensable disability. See Filing for Social Security Disability as a Veteran.)
q: The VA Said I Was 100% Disabled: Will I Get Social Security Disability? link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/va-said.html ans:In order to qualify for veterans disability compensation, the veteran must currently have a medically diagnosed disease or disability caused by an incident during active military, naval, or air service. After consideration of the evidence, the VA makes a determination regarding the applicant's degree of disability. The VA assigns the veteran a disability rating, which is measured in 10% increments ranging from 10% disabled to 100% (totally) disabled.
q: Federal Court Addresses Impact of VA Disability Rating on Social Security Disability Claim link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/federal-court-addresses-impact-va-disability-rating-socia ans:The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) gave the claimant a 70% service-connected disability rating, but paid him disability compensation at a 100% rate because they determined he was not employable. Unfortunately for the claimant, the medical records on which the VA rating was based were not provided to the Social Security Administration in advance of his disability hearing. After an appeal hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), Bird's Social Security claim was denied.
q: How Do Disability Ratings Work for Veterans Benefits? link: http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/disability/how-do-disability-ratings-work-veterans-benefi ans:The ratings are assigned in 10% increments, ranging from 10% to 100% disabled. A higher disability rating indicates the veteran has a more severe disability, and therefore receives a higher monthly compensation payment. For example, under the current wartime rates for veterans without dependents, a 10% disabled veteran is entitled to receive $123 per month, a 50% disabled veteran is entitled to receive $770 per month, and a 100% (or totally) disabled veteran is entitled to receive $2,673 per month. Generally, the compensation rates are subject to an annual cost of living increase.
