q: Understanding the Department of Veterans Affairs link: https://veteransaidbenefit.org/understanding_the_department_of_veterans_affairs.htm ans:In this book we cover all of the benefits listed above.  However, the specific focus is on service-connected and non-service-connected disability and the survivor benefits associated with these two programs.

q: Who Is Considered a Veteran for Purposes of Veterans Benefits link: https://veteransaidbenefit.org/who-is-eligible-for-veterans-benefits.htm ans:We receive numerous calls and scores of email inquiries every day to our office from would be veterans or family members of these people who want to know if they qualify for VA benefits.  The first thing we have to determine with these inquiries is if the person for whom direct benefits or survivors benefits are available is actually a veteran.  Of particular interest, we receive numerous calls from former reserve or guard members who are senior citizens and who believe that they are veterans due to their active duty training to get into the reserve or guard.  Not so.  Others who spent 20 or more years and retired from the reserve or guard and have commissary privileges at a local military installation as well as receiving a military retirement income from their service often assume that they are eligible for VA benefits.  It's just not so.    Title 38 USC Chapter 101 defines what a veteran is.  As we will learn further on this is a rather narrow definition and there are numerous groups of people who have offered service to the country who are considered veterans for benefit purposes.  Unfortunately, National Guard and reserve members only qualify as veterans if they were called up under Title 10 of the US code by the president of the United States for active duty service.  Since the Gulf War in 1990, 64% of all 1.2 million National Guard and reserve troops have been called up – some more than once.  Between 2001 and 2003 alone, President Bush called up more than 300,000 guard and reserve members.

Certain surviving spouses of veterans are also eligible for VA loans.  Veterans education benefits are perhaps one of the most valuable benefits for individuals who served in the Armed Forces.  They are very generous and many people enlist in the service to get these benefits.  Certain surviving spouses of veterans and their children are also eligible for certain education benefits as well.  Learn more.
